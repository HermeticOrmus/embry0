"""A push through the git-proxy may touch only the job's branch (#559, ADR 0009).

Before #559 the proxy streamed a receive-pack body without reading it, so a
sandbox with the push right could create, rewrite or delete any ref of its
repository: the default branch, tags, another job's branch. These tests push
with real git, configured as a sandbox is, through the proxy to ``git
http-backend`` serving a bare repository, and read the forge's refs afterwards.
