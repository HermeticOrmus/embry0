"""Repos that were renamed on the forge, and how to normalise URLs that still
name the old slug (#277).

GitHub keeps redirecting an old repo URL, so a stale stored URL still *opens*
— but it no longer *equals* the URL the forge reports for the same PR or
issue, and URL equality is what merge sync and dedup key on. Nothing rewrites
stored rows after a rename: :func:`normalize_repo_url` brings a URL arriving
at runtime (a webhook payload, an API response that predates the rename) to
the current slug, and :func:`repo_url_variants` / :func:`repo_slug_variants`
look a stored row up under every spelling it may carry.

Which repos a deployment renamed is that deployment's configuration, not the
product's (#527): the map is ``REPO_RENAMES`` in the environment, installed
once per process by :func:`configure_repo_renames`. Unset, nothing is renamed.

A slug is only matched as the ``owner/repo`` segment of a GitHub repo URL and
only up to a path boundary, so ``widgets-frontend`` or a Linear URL that
merely mentions the old name is left alone. Renames are single-hop: chain a
twice-renamed repo by mapping BOTH old slugs to the current one.
