"""What a route needs to hand a tracker a dispatch: labels, client, context.

The Linear webhook route built these inline. Accepting a Linear draft from
the API (#460) dispatches through the same service method as that webhook,
and it must do so with the same context — the same trigger labels, ledger,
jobs repository and dashboard URL — or the two would dedupe, count and
comment differently. So the construction lives here, once, and both routes
call it.
