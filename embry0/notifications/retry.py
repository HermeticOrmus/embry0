"""Shared retry policy for outbound notification sends (#252).

Every notification channel faces the same question after a failed send: was
that a blip worth another attempt, or a rejection that will come back
identical next time? Answering it once keeps Telegram, the GitHub question
comment and the signed outbound webhook from drifting apart — and stops a
single 503 from leaving a job in ``awaiting_input`` with no visible question
on that channel.

An *attempt* is an async callable performing one complete send, request
building included, so a per-attempt signature or timestamp is re-derived
naturally. It reports its outcome by returning (success) or by raising
:class:`TransientSendError` / :class:`PermanentSendError`.
:func:`send_with_retry` owns the loop, the backoff and the
``notification_retry`` / ``notification_failed`` log lines; it sleeps through
an injected function, so tests never wait and need no network.

``Retry-After`` parsing is reused from :mod:`embry0.execution.forge_client`
instead of written a second time. Only the classification differs: a
notification target is not a forge, so every 5xx counts as transient here.
