"""The sentences embry0 writes on a Linear ticket about dispatch (#284).

Kept apart from the dispatch logic so they can be read — and reviewed — as
copy. The reader is a colleague who applied a label, not an operator: every
text says (a) what happened, (b) whether they need to do anything, and
(c) exactly what. No figures, no identities, no internal error text; the
machine attribution is added at the transport (``LinearSyncService.post_comment``).

``auto_retry`` is whether a reconciler in ``on`` mode will look at the ticket
again by itself. It decides the advice: telling someone to re-apply a label is
wrong when embry0 retries on its own, and the only way forward when it does not.
