"""Forge facts the ledger needs but the pipeline does not carry (#278 part 2).

A job reports the URL of the change request it opened and nothing else, yet
the ledger's contract is that a timestamp is the FORGE's, never the moment
embry0 happened to notice (part 1, ``record_merge``). ``opened_at`` matters
for the same reason a merge time does: later readers use it to tell a genuine
forge event from a stale redelivery, and a wall clock stamped at the end of
the job reads as authoritative while being minutes or hours late.

So the open time is asked of the forge, once per PR. Failure is never fatal:
the caller is told nothing is known and falls back to a bound it can defend.
