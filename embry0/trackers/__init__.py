"""Issue-tracker abstraction (#160).

One Protocol + registry + normalized models for the systems issues arrive
from and are written back to — GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues, Linear. See
``docs/glossary.md`` ("Tracker", "Forge") for the vocabulary.

The Protocol covers what tracker *consumers* actually need: the webhook
routes call ``handle_webhook_event`` uniformly, and outbound write-back
(the #163 channel work) calls ``post_issue_comment`` uniformly. Everything
else a service exposes (Linear's GraphQL fetch, GitHub's push sync) stays
tracker-specific surface by design — forcing it onto the Protocol would be
ceremony, not abstraction.
